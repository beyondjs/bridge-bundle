# BeyondJS Bridge Bundle

## Overview

The BeyondJS Bridge Bundle is an advanced bundle designed to integrate WebSockets seamlessly into your BeyondJS
application. This bundle is essential for creating applications that require efficient real-time communication between
the client and server. It not only manages WebSocket connections but also generates the necessary client-side code,
making it easier to implement and maintain real-time features.

## Features

-   **WebSocket Integration**: Incorporates WebSocket connections to enable real-time communication.
-   **Client Code Generation**: Automatically generates client-side code needed to interact with the WebSocket server.
-   **Platform Support**: Works with packages that support the backend platform, integrating directly with WebSocket
    (`ws`) and Secure WebSocket (`wss`) protocols.
-   **Dynamic Connection Management**: Efficiently handles connection setup and management, ensuring seamless data
    exchange.

## How It Works

The Bridge Bundle establishes a dynamic communication channel between the client and server using WebSockets. It listens
for server-side changes and ensures the client is updated in real-time. The bundle generates the client-side code
necessary to handle WebSocket connections, message parsing, and event handling.

### Configuration

To configure a Bridge Bundle, you need to define it directly in your module's `module.json` file. Below is an example
configuration:

```json
{
	"name": "my-bridge-module",
	"bridge": {
		"ts": {
			"path": "ts",
			"files": ["*"]
		}
	}
}
```

### Key Properties

-   **`bridge`**: Contains configuration details specific to the Bridge Bundle.
    -   **`processors`**: Lists the processors supported by the bundle (e.g., TypeScript).

## Dynamic Client Code Generation

One of the standout features of the Bridge Bundle is its ability to dynamically generate the client-side code. This code
is responsible for managing WebSocket connections and handling real-time data updates. By generating this code
automatically, the Bridge Bundle simplifies the process of setting up and maintaining real-time communication in your
application.

### Example

Here's how to set up a module with the Bridge Bundle in BeyondJS:

1. **Create a `module.json` file** in your module directory with the following content:

    ```json
    {
    	"name": "my-bridge-module",
    	"bridge": {
    		"ts": {
    			"path": "ts",
    			"files": ["*"]
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

2. **Define your server-side logic** to handle WebSocket connections.

3. **Build your project** to see the dynamically generated client-side code.

## Advantages of Using the Bridge Bundle

-   **Real-Time Updates**: Keep your client synchronized with server changes instantly.
-   **Simplified Setup**: Reduces the complexity of integrating WebSockets by generating the necessary client code
    automatically.
-   **Enhanced User Experience**: Provides a seamless and responsive user experience through real-time data updates.

## Potential Use Cases

-   **Live Data Feeds**: Integrate live data feeds such as stock prices, sports scores, or social media updates.
-   **Collaborative Applications**: Build collaborative tools where multiple users can interact in real-time, such as
    document editing or online gaming.
-   **Notifications and Alerts**: Implement real-time notifications and alerts to keep users informed instantly.
